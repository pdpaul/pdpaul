- 👋 Hi, I’m @pdpaul
- 👀 I’m a cognitive scientist interested in entrepreneurial ventures at the intersection of cognitive science, design + tech, and social impact. 

- 🌱 I’m currently working on improving my web development skills so that I can begin building things myself (yay, self-sufficiency!) while waiting to find a collaborator who is a great fit.

- 💞️ In the near future, I’m looking to collaborate on educational game development (early math, literacy, social reasoning skills).
